# Big Corp has an in-house knowledge base / information filing
# system. It does many things, as legacy systems are prone to, and
# many of them are somewhat idiosyncratic. Either because the
# relevant standards did not exist at the time, or the responsible
# programmer didn't like the standard, so they rolled their own.

# The system has become impossible to maintain, but the databases
# contain a vast amount of information and are in active use. The
# system will be rewritten from scratch, but will stay
# backward-compatible with all the existing formats. You are on the
# team doing the rewrite (we are really sorry to hear this, honest).

# The system stores structured documents, and one of its features is
# that it can format those documents using templates. However, the
# template system got a little out of hand (they always do, don't
# they) and among other things, it is «recursive». Each piece of
# information inserted into the template is itself treated as a
# template and can have other pieces of the document substituted.

# A template looks like this:

template_1 = '''The product ‘${product}’ is made by ${manufacturer}
in ${country}. The production uses these rare-earth metals:
#{ingredients.rare_earth_metals} and these toxic substances:
#{ingredients.toxic}.''';

# The system does not treat ‹$› and ‹#› specially, unless they are
# followed by a left brace. This is a rare combination, but it turns
# out it sometimes appears in documents. To mitigate this, the
# sequences ‹$${› and ‹##{› are interpreted as literal ‹${› and
# ‹#{›. At some point, the authors of the system realized that they
# need to write literal ‹$${› into a document. So they came up with
# the scheme that when a string of 2 or more ‹$› is followed by a
# left brace, one of the ‹$› is removed and the rest is passed
# through. Same with ‹#›.

# Your first task is to write functions which escape and un-escape
# strings using the scheme explained above. The template component
# of the system is known simply as ‘template system 3’, so the
# functions will be called ‹ts3_escape› and ‹ts3_unescape›.  Return
# the altered string. If the string passed to ‹ts3_unescape›
# contains the sequence ‹#{› or ‹${›, return ‹None›, since such
# string could not have been returned from ‹ts3_escape›.
