# In this exercise, you will implement the Rail Fence cipher
# algorithm, also called the Zig-Zag cipher.

# The way this cipher works is as follows: there is a given number
# of rows (‘rails’). You write your message on those rails, starting
# in the top-left corner and moving in a zig-zag pattern: ↘ ↗ ↘ ↗ ↘
# ↗ from top to bottom rail and back to top rail, until the text
# message is exhausted.

# Example: ‹HELLO_WORLD› with 3 rails
#
#   ┌─────────────────┐
#   │ ‹ H...O...R.. › │
#   │ ‹ .E.L._.O.L. › │
#   │ ‹ ..L...W...D › │
#   └─────────────────┘
#
# The encrypted message is read off row by row: ‹HOREL_OLLWD›.

# Your task is to write the function which, given the number of
# rails/rows, returns the encrypted text.

def encrypt(text, rails):
    pass

# And decipher the text back to the sent message.

def decrypt(text, rails):
    pass
