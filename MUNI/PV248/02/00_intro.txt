# Objects, Classes and Types

This week, the exercises require static type annotations that can be
checked with ‹mypy --strict›. In most weeks from now on, prep
exercises will require ‹mypy› annotations, though they will be
optional in most tasks (but you may find them helpful). Please do
not use ‹Any› in the annotations, or the ‹type: ignore› pragma.
While not enforced by the submission evaluator (sometimes those are
hard to avoid, like the cases already present in the skeletons),
over-use will be frowned upon.

Elementary exercises:

 1. ‹geometry› – define basic types for planar geometry

Prep exercises:

 1. ‹dsw›       – Day, Stout & Warren balance binary trees
 2. ‹ts3norm›   – template system 3, normalization
 3. ‹ts3render› – template system 3, rendering into strings
 4. ‹bool›      – boolean expression trees
 5. ‹intersect› – computing intersections in a plane
 6. ‹list›      – linked list with generic type annotations

Regular exercises:

 1. ‹json›      – recursive data types without gross hacks
 2. ‹treezip›   – a zipper on binary trees
 3. ‹ts3bugs›   – more fun with template system 3
 4. ‹treap›     – randomized search trees
 5. ‹distance›  – shortest distance between two 2D objects
 6. ‹cycle›     – finding cycles in object graphs
