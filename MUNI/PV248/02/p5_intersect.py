# We first import all the classes from ‹e1_geometry›, since we will
# want to use them.

# What we will do now is compute intersection points of a few object
# type combinations. We will start with lines, which are the
# simplest. You can find closed-form general solutions for all the
# problems in this exercise on the internet. Use them.

# Line-line intersect either returns a points, or a Line, if the two
# lines are coincident, or ‹None› if they are parallel.

def intersect_line_line( p: Line, q: Line ) \
        -> Union[ Point, Line, None ]:
    pass

# A variation. Re-use the line-line case.

def intersect_line_segment( p: Line, s: Segment ) \
        -> Union[ Point, Segment, None ]:
    pass

# Intersecting lines with circles is a little more tricky. Checking
# e.g. MathWorld sounds like a good idea. It might be helpful to
# translate both objects so that the circle is centered at the
# origin. The function returns a either ‹None› (the line and circle
# do not intersect), a single ‹Point› (the line is tangent to the
# circle) or a pair of points.

def intersect_line_circle( p: Line, c: Circle ) \
        -> Union[ None, Point, Tuple[ Point, Point ] ]:
    pass

# It's probably quite obvious that users won't like the above API.
# Let's make a single ‹intersect()› that will work on anything (that
# we know how to intersect, anyway). You can use ‹type( a )› or
# ‹isinstance( a, some_type )› to find the type of object ‹a›. You
# can compare types for equality, too: ‹type( a ) == Circle› will do
# what you think it should.
