# A. Preliminaries

This document is a collection of exercises and commented source code
examples. All the sources are also available as separate files that
you can edit and compile (we will refer to these files as the
«source bundle»). Additionally, this section contains the rules and
general guidelines that apply to the course as a whole.

The latest version of this document along with the source bundle is
available both in the study materials in IS and on the student
server ‹aisa›:

 • ‹https://is.muni.cz/auth/el/fi/jaro2022/PB161/um/› – a PDF in
   ‹pb161.seminar.pdf› and the source bundle in directories ‹01›
   through ‹12›, ‹t1› through ‹t3› and ‹sol› – use the ‘download as
   ZIP’ option in the sidebar to get entire directories in one go,
 • log into ‹aisa› using ‹ssh› or ‹putty›, run ‹pb161 update›, then
   look under ‹~/pb161› (this chapter is in subdirectory ‹00›).

We will update the files as needed, to correct mistakes or include
additional material. On ‹aisa›, running ‹pb161 update› at any time
will update your working copies, taking care not to overwrite your
changes. It will also tell you which files have been updated.
