/* We will implement a simple wrapper around ‹std::fstream› that
 * will act as a temporary file. When the object is destroyed, use
 * ‹std::remove› to unlink the file. Make sure the stream is closed
 * before you unlink the file. */

/* The ‹tmpfile› class should have the following interface:
 *
 *  • a constructor which takes the name of the file
 *  • method ‹write› which takes a string and replaces the content
 *    of the file with that string; this method should flush the
 *    data to the operating system (e.g. by closing the stream)
 *  • method ‹read› which returns the current content of the file
 *  • method ‹stream› which returns a reference to an instance of
 *    ‹std::fstream› (i.e. suitable for both reading and writing)
 *
 * Calling both ‹stream› and ‹write› on the same object is undefined
 * behaviour. The ‹read› method should return all data sent to the
 * file, including data written to ‹stream()› that was not yet
 * flushed by the user. */
