/* As we have seen, subtype polymorphism allows us to define an
 * «interface» in terms of ‹virtual› methods (that is, based on late
 * dispatch) and then create various «implementations» of this
 * interface.
 *
 * It is sometimes useful to create instances of multiple different
 * derived classes based on runtime inputs, but once they are
 * created, to treat them uniformly. The uniform treatment is made
 * possible by subtype polymorphism: if the entire interaction with
 * these objects is done through the shared interface, the instances
 * are all, at the type level, interchangeable with each other. The
 * behaviour of those instances will of course differ, depending on
 * their «dynamic type». */

/* When a system is designed this way, the entire program uses a
 * single «static type» to work with all instances from the given
 * inheritance hierarchy -- the type of the base class. Let's define
 * such a base class. */

/* Let's add a simple function which operates on generic parts.
 * Working with instances is easy, since they can be passed through
 * a reference to the base type. For instance the following function
 * which formats a single line for a bill of materials (bom). */

/* However, «creation» of these instances poses a somewhat unique
 * challenge in C++: memory management. In languages like Java or
 * C#, we can create the instance and return a reference to the
 * caller, and the garbage collector will ensure that the instance
 * is correctly destroyed when it is no longer used. We do not have
 * this luxury in C++.
 *
 * Of course, we could always do memory management by hand, like
 * it's 1990. Fortunately, modern C++ provides «smart pointers» in
 * the standard library, making memory management much easier and
 * safer. Recall that a ‹unique_ptr› is an «owning» pointer: it
 * holds onto an object instance while it is in scope and destroys
 * it afterwards. Unlike objects stored in local variables, though,
 * the ownership of the instance held in a ‹unique_ptr› can be
 * transferred out of the function (i.e. an instance of ‹unique_ptr›
 * can be legally returned, unlike a reference to a local variable).
 *
 * This will make it possible to define a «factory»: a function
 * which constructs instances (parts) and returns them to the
 * caller. Of course, to actually define the function, we will need
 * to define the derived classes which it is supposed to create. */
