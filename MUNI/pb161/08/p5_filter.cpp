/* This exercise will be yet another take on a set of numbers. This
 * time, we will add a capability to filter the numbers on output.
 * It will be possible to change the filter applied to a given set
 * at runtime. */

/* The «base class» for representing filters will contain a single
 * pure ‹virtual› method, ‹accept›. The method should be marked
 * ‹const›. */

/* The ‹set› (which we will implement below) will «own» the filter
 * instance and hence will use a ‹unique_ptr› to hold it. */

/* The ‹set› should have standard methods: ‹add› and ‹has›, the
 * latter of which will respect the configured filter (i.e. items
 * rejected by the filter will always test negative on ‹has›). The
 * method ‹set_filter› should set the filter. If no filter is set,
 * all numbers should be accepted. Calling ‹set_filter› with a
 * ‹nullptr› argument should clear the filter. */

/* Additionally, ‹set› should have ‹begin› and ‹end› methods (both
 * ‹const›) which return very simple iterators that only provide
 * «dereference» to an ‹int› (value), pre-increment and inequality.
 * It is a good idea to keep «two» instances of
 * ‹std::set< int >::iterator› in attributes (in addition to a
 * pointer to the output filter): you will need to know, in the
 * pre-increment operator, that you ran out of items when skipping
 * numbers which the filter rejected. */
