# T.1. Introductory Tasks

The programming tasks for this block are as follows:

 1. ‹cellular.*› – a simple cellular automaton simulator,
 2. ‹magic.*› – a backtracking magic square solver,
 3. ‹reversi.*› – a 3D version of the game reversi,
 4. ‹chess.*› – a simple simulator of standard chess.

In this set, the tasks only require basic programming skills and C++
constructs that you have encountered in the first two chapters. In
other words, no advanced language constructs or library features
are necessary.
