 * values dynamically allocated from the heap. We will implement a
 * simple one-way, non-indexable queue. We will require that it is
 * possible to erase elements from the middle in O(1), without
 * invalidating any other iterators. The standard containers
 * which could fit:
 *
 *  • ‹std::deque› fails the erase in the middle requirement,
 *  • ‹std::forward_list› does not directly support queue-like
 *    operation, hence using it as a queue is possible but awkward;
 *    wrapping ‹std::forward_list› would be, however, a viable
 *    approach to this task, too,
 *  • ‹std::list› works well as a queue out of the box, but has
 *    twice the memory overhead of ‹std::forward_list›.
 *
 * As usual, since we do not yet understand templates, we will only
 * implement a queue of integers, but it is not hard to imagine we
 * could generalize to any type of element. */
