# T.3. Tasks with Templates and Iterators

The programming tasks for this block are as follows:

 1. ‹tree.*› – iterating trees in post-order,
 2. ‹bplus.*› – a class template implementing B+ trees,
 3. ‹linalg.*› – complex and real linear algebra,
 4. ‹lisp.*› – a simple interpreter for a LISP-like language.

All tasks in this block make some use of templates, which are
covered in chapters 9 and 10, and of course they also rely on
knowledge from previous blocks. Since the first task is about
writing iterators, you will also need to understand the material
from chapter 11 to complete it (though you should be able to make
considerable progress with what you know from chapter 5).
