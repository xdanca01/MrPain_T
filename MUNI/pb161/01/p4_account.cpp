/* In this exercise, you will create a simple class: it will encapsulate some
 * state (account balance) and provide a simple, safe interface around that
 * state. The class should have the following interface:
 *
 *  • the constructor takes 2 integer arguments: the initial balance and the
 *    maximum overdraft
 *  • a ‹withdraw› method which returns a boolean: it performs the action and
 *    returns ‹true› iff there was sufficient balance to do the withdrawal
 *  • a ‹deposit› method which adds funds to the account
 *  • a ‹balance› method which returns the current balance (may be negative)
 *    and that can be called on ‹const› instances of ‹account› */
