/* Exceptions are, as their name suggests, a mechanism for handling
 * unexpected or otherwise «exceptional» circumstances, typically
 * error conditions. A canonic example would be trying to open a
 * file which does not exist, trying to allocate memory when there
 * is no free memory left and the like. Another common circumstance
 * would be errors during processing user input: bad format,
 * unexpected switches and so on.
 *
 * NB. Do «not» use exceptions for ‘normal’ control flow, e.g.  for
 * terminating loops. That is a «really» bad idea (even though ‹try›
 * blocks are cheap, throwing exceptions is very expensive). */

/* This example will be somewhat banal. We start by creating a class
 * which has a global counter of instances attached to it: i.e. the
 * value of ‹counter› tells us how many instances of ‹counted› exist
 * at any given time. Fair warning, do not do this at home. */
