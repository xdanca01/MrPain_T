/* In this demo, we will implement a simple semaphore. A semaphore
 * is a device which guards a resource of which there are multiple
 * instances, but the number of instances is limited. It is a slight
 * generalization of a mutex (which guards a singleton resource).
 * Internally, semaphore simply counts the number of clients who
 * hold the resource and refuses further requests if the maximum is
 * reached. In a multi-threaded program, semaphores would typically
 * block (wait for a slot to become available) instead of refusing.
 * In a single-threaded program (which is what we are going to use
 * for a demonstration), this would not work. Hence our ‹get› method
 * returns a ‹bool›, indicating whether acquisition of the lock
 * succeeded. */
