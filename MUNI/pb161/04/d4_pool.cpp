/* This demo will be our first serious foray into dealing with
 * object lifetime. In particular, we will want to implement binary
 * trees – clearly, the lifetime of tree nodes must exactly match
 * the lifetime of the tree itself:
 *
 *  • if the nodes were released too early, the program would
 *    perform invalid memory access when traversing the tree,
 *  • if the nodes are not released with the tree, that would
 *    be a memory leak – we keep the nodes around, but cannot
 *    access them.
 *
 * This is an ubiquitous problem, and if you think about it, we have
 * encountered it a lot, but did not have to think about it yet: the
 * characters in an ‹std::string› or the items in an ‹std::vector›
 * have the same property: their lifetime must match the lifetime of
 * the instance which «owns them».
 *
 * This is one of the most important differences between C and C++:
 * if we do C++ right, most of the time, we do not need to manage
 * object lifetimes manually. This is achieved through two main
 * mechanisms:
 *
 *  1. pervasive use of «automatic variables», through «value
 *     semantics» – local variables and arguments are «automatically
 *     destroyed» when they go out of scope,
 *  2. «cascading» – whenever an object is destroyed, its attributes
 *     are also destroyed «automatically», and a mechanism is provided
 *     for classes which own additional, non-attribute objects (e.g.
 *     elements in an ‹std::vector›) to automatically destroy them
 *     too (this is achieved by «user-defined destructors» which we
 *     will explore in part 6, two weeks from now).
 *
 * In general, destroying objects at an appropriate time is the job
 * of the «owner» of the object – whether the owner is a function
 * (this is the case with by-value arguments and local variables) or
 * another object (attributes, elements of a container and so on).
 * Additionally, this happens «transparently» for the user: the
 * compiler takes care of inserting the right calls at the right
 * places to ensure everything is destroyed at the right time.
 *
 * The end result is modular or «composable» resource management –
 * well-behaved objects can be composed into well-behaved composites
 * without any additional glue or boilerplate.
 *
 * To make things easy for now, we will take advantage of existing
 * containers to do resource management for us, which will save us
 * from writing destructors (the proverbial glue, which is boring to
 * write and easy to get wrong). In part 7, we will see how we can
 * use «smart pointers» for the same purpose. */

/* We will be keeping the nodes of our binary tree in an
 * ‹std::vector› – this means that each node has an «index» which we
 * can use to refer to that node. In other words, in this demo (and
 * in some of this week's exercises) indices will play the role of
 * pointers. Since 0 is a valid index, we will use -1 to indicate an
 * invalid (‘null’) reference. Besides ‘pointers’ to the left and
 * right child, the node will contain a single integer value. */

/* As mentioned earlier, the nodes will be held in a vector: let's

using node_pool = std::vector< node >;

/* Working with ‹node› is, however, rather inconvenient: we cannot
 * ‘dereference’ the ‹left›/‹right› ‘pointers’ without going through
 * ‹node_pool›. This makes for verbose code which is unpleasant to
 * both read and to write. But we can do better: let's add a simple
 * wrapper class, which will remember both a reference to the
 * ‹node_pool› and an index of the ‹node› we are interested in: this
 * class can then behave like a proper reference to ‹node›: only a
 * value of the ‹node_ref› type is needed to access the node and to
 * walk the tree. */

     * arise when we encounter a node with a missing child – that
     * missing node is represented as index -1. The ‹valid› method
     * allows the user to check whether the reference is valid. The
     * remaining methods (‹left›, ‹right› and ‹value›) must not be
